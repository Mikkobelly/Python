# Task 1.2

## Task goals:

  - Create virtual enviroment to avoid package version conflicts
  - Creat python file (add.py) that adds two numbers that the user enters and print the result to the console

## Folders / Files:

  - Code Practice folder that contains the screenshots and the file for the optional task
  - screenshots of the task (step by step)
  - learning journal 1.2

## Data Structure:

 ### each recipe structure
  I decided to use dictionary for the data structure so that it is easier to track and access the required data as each values inside are individually labelled.  

### all-recipes structure
  I decided to use list for the data structure because the list allows you to easily modify the data which will be useful for when adding/deleting new recipe or editing     each recipe's data such as ingredients.
