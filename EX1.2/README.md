## Data Structure

 ### Each recipe Structure
  I decided to use dictionary for the data structure so that it is easier to track and access the required data as each values inside are individually labelled.  

### All-recipes Structure
  I decided to use list for the data structure because the list allows you to easily modify the data which will be useful for when adding/deleting new recipe or editing     each recipe's data such as ingredients.
